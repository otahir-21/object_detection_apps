# Object Detection App with Flutter

This is an object detection app built using Flutter, where the user can select an object (e.g., laptop, mobile, bottle) and interact with the camera to detect the selected object using machine learning models. The app will guide the user based on the detection results and capture the image when the object is detected correctly.

## Features
•⁠  ⁠Select an object from a list (e.g., laptop, mobile, mouse, bottle).
•⁠  ⁠Real-time object detection using the camera feed.
•⁠  ⁠Dynamic guidance messages based on detection (move closer or farther).
•⁠  ⁠Auto-capture when the object is detected within the ideal size.
•⁠  ⁠Display the captured image with metadata (e.g., object type, date, timestamp).

## Requirements
•⁠  ⁠Flutter SDK (version 2.x or later)
•⁠  ⁠Dart SDK
•⁠  ⁠A physical device or emulator to run the app

## Installation & Setup
